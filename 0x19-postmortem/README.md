# 0x19. Postmortem

## DevOps | SysAdmin

### Project Overview
Welcome to the 0x19 Postmortem project, where we embrace the inevitability of failure! This project is all about documenting and analyzing a system outage or a web stack debugging issue through a detailed postmortem report. The aim is to learn from the failure and ensure it doesn’t happen again.

### Background Context
In the world of software engineering, failures are as certain as bugs in the code. These failures can be due to various reasons: traffic spikes, security issues, hardware malfunctions, or even good old human error. The goal is to turn these failures into learning opportunities by conducting a thorough postmortem.

A postmortem helps to:
1. Provide clear information to the rest of the company about the outage, ensuring everyone is on the same page.
2. Identify the root cause of the outage and implement measures to prevent recurrence.

### Project Requirements
You are required to write a postmortem report for a web stack debugging issue or an invented outage scenario. The postmortem should include the following sections:

1. **Issue Summary**  
   - **Duration:** Start and end times (including timezone).
   - **Impact:** What services were down or slow? What were users experiencing? How many users were affected?
   - **Root Cause:** The underlying reason for the outage.

2. **Timeline**  
   A bullet-point format that includes:
   - When and how the issue was detected.
   - Actions taken, investigations conducted, and any assumptions made.
   - Misleading investigation paths.
   - Teams or individuals involved in the incident resolution.
   - How the incident was ultimately resolved.

3. **Root Cause and Resolution**  
   - A detailed explanation of the issue's cause.
   - A thorough description of how the issue was fixed.

4. **Corrective and Preventative Measures**  
   - Suggestions for improvements or fixes to prevent future issues.
   - A list of specific tasks to address the root cause.

### Making Your Postmortem Engaging
It’s important to make your postmortem engaging to ensure that it’s read by your peers. Consider adding elements like humor, diagrams, or visuals to grab attention and make the content more memorable.

### Project Tasks
1. **My First Postmortem**  
   Write a postmortem based on a real or fictional web stack debugging issue.
   
   **File:** `README.md` in the `0x19-postmortem` directory.

2. **Make People Want to Read Your Postmortem**  
   Enhance your postmortem with visuals or humor to make it more appealing.

   **File:** `README.md` in the `0x19-postmortem` directory.

### Manual QA Review
Once you’ve completed your postmortem, it’s crucial to request a peer review before the project deadline. If no peers are available, you may request a review from a TA or staff member.
